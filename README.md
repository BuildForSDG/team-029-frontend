# Good health and well-being
Good health and well-being is one of Sustainable Development Goals(SDG) challenges. The aims of this application is to provide solutions that can help avoid, alert, inform, monitor and report road injuries and deaths.

# Why
This aims to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life. While there has been significant improvement in global health in the last two decades, further progress is needed. Over the last 15 years, the number of childhood deaths has been cut in half. This proves that it is possible to win the fight against almost every disease. Still, we are spending an astonishing amount of money and resources on treating illnesses that are surprisingly easy to prevent. The new goal for worldwide Good Health promotes healthy lifestyles, preventive measures and modern, efficient healthcare for everyone.
